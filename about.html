      <h3>About Me</h3>

      <p>I’m a designer based in Salt Lake City, Utah. My focus is primarily on user experience and interface design, but I also have a tons of experience writing front-end code. </p>


      <p>Depending on the time of year you might find me hiking or skiing in one of Utah’s beautiful mountain ranges, or trapsing through the deserts in Southern Utah.</p>

      <p>A lot of my free time is devoted to reading, writing, and creatively expressing ideas. I occasionally post things on <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@kirbyyardley">Medium</a> and also have a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJHUnUBHETnsTj4uFghY2kA">Youtube channel</a> where I post essays about psychology, art, and film. </p>
