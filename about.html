        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Product design is exciting because it allows me to do two of my favorite things: (1) making awesome things (2) learning about people.</p>

        <p>Learning about people may be what draws me toward human-centric design. You'll occasionally find me very amateurishly poking around inside the great minds of psychologists and philosophers like Carl Jung and Friedrich Nietzsche, or perhaps listening to whatever lectures I can find on YouTube.</p>
