        <h3 id="design">I. Sketch Overhaul (Design Debt)</h3>
        <p>Sketch 41 introduced nested symbol overrides. This powerful change would enable designers to make symbols out of smaller symbols and have the ability to change content within them. This was huge and was the obvious starting point for this project.</p>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/ux-power-tools/this-is-without-a-doubt-the-coolest-sketch-technique-youll-see-all-day-ddefa65ea959#.pevfkykqk">Jon Moore</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@lloyd/sketch-symbols-best-practices-now-that-nested-overrides-are-a-thing-9b651d3fe1a4#.3jsbforui">Lloyd Humphries</a>, do a great job of highlighting how best to take advantage of these. Their application of deep-nested symbols enables designers to build nearly every element of a screen as a symbol, with overrides allowing for every symbol to have unique content. This approach to crafting designs is extremely efficient.</p>

        <p>Rather than rebuilding all of my existing components as symbols, I opted to use UX Power Tools Toolbox as my starting point. After some intense modifications to their entire document, I recreated all of the patterns and designs for Sundance.org. I ended up with hundreds of new symbols. And symbols nested in symbols nested in symbols. These screenshots give you a sense that what is happening is chaotic, but there is real ingenuity at work here. </p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>In addition to this dramatic change in formatting, I also took advantage of this opportunity to make a few tweaks, namely adding a baseline grid to our typographic ecosystem. </p>

        <h3 id="code">II. Refactoring with ITCSS/BEM</h3>
        <p>CSS is only as clean and organized as its author dictates. My first attempt at writing CSS on a very large scale was in 2014 when we relaunched Sundance.org. I made some poor decisions along the way by organizing our CSS in a way that doesn't allow for styles to be shared more widely across the site and selectors that are way too specific. </p>
        <p>We spent some time researching ways to refactor our CSS and had many conversations with our devs. Ultimately we narrowed things down to ITCSS as a methodology and BEM as our naming convention.</p>
        <p>The ITCSS methodology is based on the idea of organizing CSS in an inverted triangle starting from most broad and far-reaching styles at the top of the hierarchy and building downward to increasingly specific elements. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:</p>
        <ul class="o-list-bare">
          <li>1. Settings (variables, font sizes, colors, configs)</li>
          <li>2. Tools (preprocessor mixins and functions)</li>
          <li>3. Generic (normalize, reset, box-sizing)</li>
          <li>4. Elements (HTML DOM elements, no classes)</li>
          <li>5. Objects (non-cosmetic design patterns like wrappers and layouts)</li>
          <li>6. Components (cosmetic design patterns)</li>
          <li>7. Overrides (otherwise known as the shame folder)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-scale-web-projects-new-css-architecture-itcss-41514731">For those interested, Harry Roberts (the creator) provides a fantastic, in-depth explanation</a>.</p>

        <p>I had initially wanted to avoid the use of a framework, but as luck would have it, Harry Roberts created InuitCSS. InuitCSS is a framework comprised of both ITCSS and BEM. A framework in its purest sense, InuitCSS comes only with the basic architecture of a CSS library. It contains nothing in the way of design. <em>Music to my ears!</em></p>

        <p>This worked extremely well. InuitCSS has so much utility out of the box that you can assemble entire patterns without having to write very many additional custom classes.</p>

        <h3 id="jekyll">III. Abstract Refactoring</h3>

        <p>One of the biggest risks when performing a refactor of this scale is that you are making sweeping changes to the codebase. As this is happening, coordinating work between the team becomes very challenging and you're now having to toil with two separate libraries of CSS at once. Our team really wanted to avoid this nightmare. I opted to write an entire abstract CSS library first.</p>

        <p>I spun up a Jekyll instance, installed Inuit and started assembling our new CSS library on a static front-end by building out every component on Sundance.org. In order for our team to be able to review and contribute, I shared the repo and hosted it as a live web page on Github Pages (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kirbyyardley/Sundance-Styleguide">repo</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://kirbyyardley.github.io/Sundance-Styleguide/cards/">live version</a>). Since we were building this static set of front-end components anyway, it made perfect sense for us to turn this into our living style guide. Complete with design documentation, live examples and code snippets, this is now a great resource for our developers for future projects.</p>

          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/3@desktop u-1/3@tablet u-1/2@mobile">
            <img data-action="zoom" src="{{ "assets/img/styleguide-1.png" | relative_url }}">
          </div>
          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/3@desktop u-1/3@tablet u-1/2@mobile">
            <img data-action="zoom" src="{{ "assets/img/styleguide-0.png" | relative_url }}">
          </div>
          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/3@desktop u-1/3@tablet u-1/1@mobile">
            <img data-action="zoom" src="{{ "assets/img/styleguide-0.png" | relative_url }}">
          </div>
        </div>

        <p><br>And we were off to the races!</p>

        <p style="color: #999;"><em>At the time that I am writing this, we're putting the finishing touches are some of the primary elements before moving forward with integrating it into the production site. I'll be sure to update this post with anything conclusive. So far, so good!</em></p>

        <h3>What did we learn?</h3>
        <p>We're recognizing more and more that having developers present for design is critical to a project's success. For similar reasons, having designers who can help manage front-end code adds a lot of utility and is enabling for teams. Rather than trying to solve the "handoff" problem, the "handoff" itself almost goes away entirely.</p>
        <p>Teams are becoming more and more cross-functional. As a result, I think the gap between designers and developers will close even further and breed more precise communication, faster output, and ultimately better work.</p>
