        <p>An historical database containing decades of Sundance-supported events, projects and artists.</p>

        <p style="color: #999;"><em>At the time that I am writing this, the project is in the development stage. I'll be sure to update this post once we go live!</em></p>

        <p>The Digital Archive is a database containing records of every project and artist that Sundance Institute has supported, either through our many artist programs or by showing the films at festivals. In addition to migrating this database from an old, archaic Filemaker database, we took this opportunity to make significant design updates to its front-end. We would be making severe changes to the layout and functionality of the database itself, as well as determining how best to integrate it with the rest of Sundance.org through related content (blogs, photos, video).</p>

        <p>This was also the opportunity to integrate a Watch Now feature, which would allow users to see where films were available to watch online.</p>

        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
        <p>We started by interviewing a diverse range of users who had been using the old database and identified three distinct user personas, each with itâ€™s own specific needs and goals. We came away with three key user personas.</p>

        <div class="o-layout">
          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/3@desktop u-1/3@tablet u-1/1">
            <h4>Audience</h4>
            <p><strong>Needs</strong><br>Audience-oriented information, release dates, ways to watch, what films to watch</p>
            <p><strong>Goal</strong><br>To learn more about films they are interested in viewing.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/3@desktop u-1/3@tablet u-1/1">
            <h4>Reporter</h4>
            <p><strong>Needs</strong><br>Highly specific info/stats relating to films, artists.</p>
            <p><strong>Goal</strong><br>To publish content related to specific films in support of the artist and their work.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/3@desktop u-1/3@tablet u-1/1">
            <h4>Donor</h4>
            <p><strong>Needs</strong><br>Information on specific projects, artists that were institute-supported.</p>
            <p><strong>Goal</strong><br>To know that their support for Sundance Institute is having an impact.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>These interviews highlighted that the advanced search tool from the old database was extremely crucial for them. We elevated this as a key requirement for us to focus on in a forthcoming project that will look to create a more unified Sundance.org search.</p>

        <h3>Database Tour</h3>
        <p>Next we took a deep dive into the database where all of the info lived. This would help us paint an accurate picture of how these sets of data are related to each other, which would also help us determine, hierarchtically, how best to allow users to navigate our database.</p>

        <div class="o-layout o-layout--center">
          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/2@desktop u-1/2">
            <img data-action="zoom" src="{{ "assets/img/history-3.png" | relative_url }}">
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>A big issue surfaced as we recognized that many films had multiple unique database records as a result of having seen multiple iterations of support from Sundance. (Example: <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> was supported at the 1991 Directors Lab, went on to screen at the 1992 Sundance Film Festival and 2011 Festival in London). To solve this we introduced <strong>tabs</strong> as a design pattern. This allowed us to present each unique iteration of a project on a single page, as well as highlight the timeline of support that a project received.</p>

        <div class="o-layout o-layout--center">
          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/2@desktop u-1/2">
            <img data-action="zoom" src="{{ "assets/img/history-8.png" | relative_url }}">
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Biggest Opportunity for Impact: Film Pages</h3>
        <p>Our analytics pointed to film pages, second only to the landing page of the archive, as being the place where users were entering (via external links or organic search) and exiting the most. This was the biggest opportuntiy to provide users with the information they were seeking. Our Watch Now feature would provide audiences with the ability to watch films that are available. Through related content we would be providing reporters and donors the entirety of project's story. </p>

        <h3>Comparative Assessment</h3>
        <p>We selected IMDB, The King Center, Festival de Cannes Archive, and Google's Cultural Institute for our comparative assessment. We wanted to explore a diverse set of database products to help identify strengths, weaknesses and design patterns that might prove useful for our own database.</p>

        <div class="o-layout">
          <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;" class="o-layout__item u-1/4@desktop u-1/4@tablet u-1/2">
            <img data-action="zoom" src="{{ "assets/img/history-5.jpg" | relative_url }}">
          </div>
          <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;" class="o-layout__item u-1/4@desktop u-1/4@tablet u-1/2">
            <img data-action="zoom" src="{{ "assets/img/history-4.jpg" | relative_url }}">
          </div>
          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/4@desktop u-1/4@tablet u-1/2">
            <img data-action="zoom" src="{{ "assets/img/history-6.jpg" | relative_url }}">
          </div>
          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/4@desktop u-1/4@tablet u-1/2">
            <img data-action="zoom" src="{{ "assets/img/history-7.jpg" | relative_url }}">
          </div>
        </div>

        <p style="margin-top: 30px;">A few key takeaways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A carefully crafted, story-driven landing page best serves featured/curated historical content.</li>
          <li>Caution: Avoid visual oversaturization. Create clear pathways into content.</li>
          <li>Connect people with something historical.</li>
          <li>Simplification is something many databases struggle with.</li>
          <li>Hierarchy matters and determining this within the context of a database of information is not always clear.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Prototype Screens</h3>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Testing & Iteration</h3>
        <p>The Digital Archive has been long awaiting its return to Sundance.org, so our goal is to launch it as an MVP as soon as possible. We've chosen to focus primarily on usability testing as well as determining how this will impact the site's search functionality. Once we are live, we'll be utilizing session recording software and A/B testing in order to begin iterating.</p>

        <p>Here are the two key hypotheses we'll be testing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Our audience is willing to use Sundance.org as a way of finding films they want to watch online. The "watch" feature will get put to use and we'll see visitors return to find films to watch.</li>
          <li>Users will actively engage with the related content displaying alongside database information. This will further Sundance's ability to tell its story.</li>
        </ul>
