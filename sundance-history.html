        <!-- <h3>The Goal</h3> -->
        <p>The digital archive is a database that allows people to connect with projects and artists that Sundance Institute has supported going all the way back to 1980.</p>
        <p><em>Role: UX Design, UI Design, Front-End Developement</em></p>

  <div class="o-wrapper" style="width:100%;">
    <div class="o-layout">

        <img  data-action="zoom" style="margin-bottom: 24px;" src="{{ "assets/img/history-00.jpg" | relative_url }}" alt="">

        <p>Our aim with this project, in addition to giving this old database a much-needed facelift, was to align it more closely with the needs of our users. By integrating the database with the rest of Sundance.org, as well as introducing a "Watch Now" feature, this would help Sundance Institute to tell its decades-long story of supporting artists.</p>

        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
        <p>We interviewed a diverse set of users who had been using the old version of our database. From these interviews, we were able to identify three key personas.</p>

        <img data-action="zoom" src="{{ "assets/img/history-personas.png" | relative_url }}">

        <h3>Database Tour</h3>
        <p>A deep dive into the database where all of these records lived showed us a clear hierarchy and how these records related to each other.</p>

        <div class="o-layout o-layout--center">
          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/2@desktop u-1/2">

          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- <p>A big issue surfaced as we recognized that many films had multiple unique database records as a result of having seen multiple iterations of support from Sundance. (Example: <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> was supported at the 1991 Directors Lab, went on to screen at the 1992 Sundance Film Festival and 2011 Festival in London). To solve this we introduced <strong>tabs</strong> as a design pattern. This allowed us to present each unique iteration of a project on a single page, as well as highlight the timeline of support that a project received.</p>-->

        <p>Projects that had seen multiple iterations of support from the institute created a very interesting challenge. Each iteration of a project was unique and likely didn't have the same description or credits. An actor that worked on a film while at the labs was not likely to appear in the final production of that film that went on to screen at the festival.</p>

        <p>We used tabs as a design pattern to help solve this problem. Tabs help to communicate the full timeline of a project as it relates to Sundance, but still allows for the unique information to remain intact.</p>

        <h3>Comparative Assessment</h3>
        <p>We selected IMDB, The King Center, Festival de Cannes Archive, and Google's Cultural Institute for our comparative assessment. We wanted to explore a diverse set of database products to help identify strengths, weaknesses and design patterns that might prove useful for our own database.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 30px;">A few key takeaways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A carefully crafted, story-driven landing page best serves featured/curated historical content.</li>
          <li>Caution: Avoid visual oversaturation. Create clear pathways into content.</li>
          <li>Connect people with something historical. </li>
          <li>Simplification is something many databases struggle with.</li>
          <li>Hierarchy matters and determining this within the context of a database of information is not always clear.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- <h3>Testing & Iteration</h3>
        <p>The Digital Archive has been long awaiting its return to Sundance.org, so our goal is to launch it as an MVP as soon as possible. Once we are live, we'll be utilizing session recording software and A/B testing in order to begin testing our conceptsiterating.</p> -->

        <p>Here are the two key hypotheses we'll be testing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Our audience is willing to use Sundance.org as a way of finding films they want to watch online. The "watch" feature will get put to use and we'll see visitors return to find films to watch.</li>
          <li>Users will actively engage with the related content displaying alongside database information. This will further Sundance's ability to tell its story.</li>
        </ul>
