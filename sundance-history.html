        <p>An historical database containing decades of Sundance-supported events, projects and artists.</p>

        <p style="color: #999;"><em>At the time that I am writing this, the project is in the development stage. I'll be sure to update this post once we go live!</em></p>

        <p>The Digital Archive is a database containing records of every project and artist that Sundance Institute has supported, either through our many artist programs or by showing the films at festivals. In addition to migrating this database from an old, archaic filemaker database, we took this opportunity to make significant design updates to its front-end. We would be making severe changes to the layout and functionality of the database itself, as well as determining how best to integrate it with the rest of Sundance.org through related content (blogs, photos, video).

        <p>This was also the opportunity to introduce the first iteration of our long-sought "Watch" feature. Users could see where the films were available to watch online.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
        <p>We interviewed a diverse range of users who had been using the old database and identified three distinct user personas, each with itâ€™s own specific needs and goals.</p>

        <div class="o-layout">
          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/3@desktop u-1/3@tablet u-1/2@mobile">
            <h4>Audience</h4>
            <p><strong>Needs</strong><br>Audience-oriented information, release dates, ways to watch, what films to watch</p>
            <p><strong>Goal</strong><br>To learn more about films they are interested in viewing.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/3@desktop u-1/3@tablet u-1/2@mobile">
            <h4>Reporter</h4>
            <p><strong>Needs</strong><br>Highly specific info/stats relating to films, artists.</p>
            <p><strong>Goal</strong><br>To publish content related to specific films in support of the artist and their work.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/3@desktop u-1/3@tablet u-1/1@mobile">
            <h4>Donor</h4>
            <p><strong>Needs</strong><br>Information on specific projects, artists that were institute-supported.</p>
            <p><strong>Goal</strong><br>To know that their support for Sundance Institute is having an impact.</p>
          </div>
        </div>








        <h3>Database Tour</h3>
        <p>In order to wrap our heads around the information we were designing for, we took a deep dive into the database where all of the info lived. This would help us paint an accurate picture of how these sets of data are related to each other, which would also help us determine, hierarchtically, how best to allow users to navigate into and between pages within the database.</p>

        <div class="o-layout o-layout--center">
          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/2@desktop u-1/2@tablet u-1/1">
            <img data-action="zoom" src="{{ "assets/img/history-3.png" | relative_url }}">
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Identifying the Place Where We Could Make the Most Impact: Film Pages</h3>
        <p>Our analytics data pointed to film pages being the place where users were exiting the most. This seemed to be the place where people had reached their goal. <em>They found the film they were looking for and were either satisfied with the information or found it wanting.</em> Film pages were also getting the majority of our traffic Our biggest opportunity to further engagement would be from this screen.</p>
        <p>We also had to deal with the issue that many films had a unique page based on which event it was associated with. (Example: Before <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> screened at the 1992 Sundance Film Festival, it was part of the 1991 Directors Lab). To solve this problem, we would need to consolidate this information onto a single page, but continue to contextual how the project evolved over time. We introduced tabs specific to each iteration of the film. </p>

        <div class="o-layout o-layout--center">
          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/2@desktop u-1/2@tablet u-1/1">
            <img data-action="zoom" src="{{ "assets/img/history-8.png" | relative_url }}">
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Comparative Assessment</h3>
        <p>By exploring the work that others have done, it would help us to identify design patterns that may work for us and well as avoid any potential pitfalls. We also wanted to expand our view beyond the world of film and entertainment by assessing a diverse range of database or historical products. </p>

        <p>We chose to review IMDB, The King Center, Festival de Cannes Archive, and Google's Cultural Institute. </p>

        <div class="o-layout">
          <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;" class="o-layout__item u-1/4@desktop u-1/4@tablet u-1/2@mobile">
            <img data-action="zoom" src="{{ "assets/img/history-5.jpg" | relative_url }}">
          </div>
          <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;" class="o-layout__item u-1/4@desktop u-1/4@tablet u-1/2@mobile">
            <img data-action="zoom" src="{{ "assets/img/history-4.jpg" | relative_url }}">
          </div>
          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/4@desktop u-1/4@tablet u-1/2@mobile">
            <img data-action="zoom" src="{{ "assets/img/history-6.jpg" | relative_url }}">
          </div>
          <div class="o-layout__item u-1/4@desktop u-1/4@tablet u-1/2@mobile">

          </div>
        </div>

        <p style="margin-top: 30px;">A few key takeaways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A carefully crafted, story-driven landing page layout best serves featured/curated historical content.</li>
          <li>Caution: Avoid visual oversaturization. Create clear pathways into content.</li>
          <li>Connect people with something historical.</li>
          <li>Hierarchy matters. Elevate the information users are seeking most. <em>I'm very interested to see how our decisions plays out in user tests</em>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Prototypes</h3>


        <h3>Moving Forward & Iteration</h3>
        <p>The Digital Archive has been long awaiting its return to Sundance.org, so our goal is to launch it as an MVP as soon as possible. We've chosen to focus primarily on usability testing as well as determining how this will impact the site's search functionality. Once we are live, we'll be utilizing session recording software and A/B testing in order to begin validation.</p>

        <p>Here are the two key hypotheses we'll be testing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Our audience is willing to use Sundance.org as a way of finding films they want to watch online. The "watch" feature will get put to use.</li>
          <li>Users will actively engage with the related content displaying alongside database information. This will further Sundance's ability to tell its story.</li>
        </ul>
