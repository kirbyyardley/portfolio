      <h2>Case Study: Sundance.org Digital Archive</h2>
      <p>The digital archive is home to all the data pertaining to the projects and artists that Sundance Institute has supported for nearly four decades. The database currently lives on archaic technology, but will soon be migrated into a modern database environment. This migration will enable Sundance to more effectively integrate their historical project data with other areas of Sundance.org. This project explores how the database's front end will be refurbished to more closely align with the needs of its primary users. </p>

      <h3>User Interviews</h3>
      <p>We interviewed a diverse set of users who had been working with the old version of our database. From these interviews, we were able to identify three key personas: audience members, reporters, and donors. </p>

      <h3>Database Tour</h3>
      <p>We focused a lot of time touring the old database (The Source) and assembling a clear picture of the existing data structure. This work enabled us to construct a working model of the database's overall hierarchy. This breakdown is an oversimplification of that hierarchy, but helps paint a picture of the old database's overall structure.</p>

      <p>Some projects, such as Reservoir Dogs, would appear under different parent events (eg. 1991 Directors Lab, 1992 Sundance Film Festival). Each iteration of the project was unique and therefore had it's own unique record which we needed to preserve in order to keep the historical record intact.</p>

      <p>The design pattern that came in really handy in this instance was tabs, which would enable users to see the multitude of a project's support on a single page.</p>

      <h3>Comparative Assessment</h3>
      <p>We selected IMDB, The King Center, Festival de Cannes Archive, and Google's Cultural Institute for our comparative assessment. We wanted to explore a diverse set of database products to help identify strengths, weaknesses and design patterns that might prove useful for our own database.</p>

      <p style="margin-top: 30px;">A few key takeaways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A carefully crafted, story-driven landing page best serves featured/curated historical content.</li>
        <li>Caution: Avoid visual oversaturation. Create clear pathways into content.</li>
        <li>Connect people with something historical. </li>
        <li>Simplification is something many databases struggle with.</li>
        <li>Hierarchy matters and determining this within the context of a database of information is not always clear.</li>
      </ul>
