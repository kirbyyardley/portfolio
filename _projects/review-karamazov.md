      <h3>Review: <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em></h3>

      <p>As Russia was evolving into modernity in the latter half of the 19th century, Fyodor Dostoyevsky was keenly aware of the rapidly shifting world around him. Religious belief was in decline and the “new man” was beginning to stake his claim on the world. New political and philosophical questions were being asked, which the author goes to great lengths to address in this book. Dostoyevsky gives each facet of every philosophical idea a fair share of the spotlight. Imbued in every scene and character arc is a dialogue about the nature of man and his relationship to society, nature, and God.</p>

      <p>I suspect Dostoevsky's religious convictions shines most brightly through the character of Alyosha, who seems to single-handedly redeem everyone around him through his innate good-naturedness, but this reads to me as anything but propaganda. By the end of the book, I came away with no more certainty as to the beliefs of its author than when I had started. I did, however, come away with a more refined understanding of my own, or at least a more refined understanding of the questions that life forces one to ask.</p>

      <p>This book is nothing short of a literary and philosophical masterpiece and has instantly become one of my favorite novels of all time. While I’m heartened by the fact that I have so many of Dostoevsky's novels left to read, I have a sinking suspicion that I may not read something as tremendous as <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>.</p>
