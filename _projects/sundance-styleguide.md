      <h4 id="design">I. Sketch Overhaul (Design Debt)</h4>

      <p><a href="https://blog.sketchapp.com/an-iconic-new-look-and-more-4191df5ce8d7" target="_blank">Sketch 41</a> introduced nested symbol overrides, making it one of the single greatest Sketch updates to date. Designers could now create an entire microcosm of symbols by nesting symbols inside of symbols inside of more symbols. After Sketch 41 was released I soon realized that I was going to have revamp all my Sketch files. Thankfully there are brilliant people in this world who are always paving the way.</p>

      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/ux-power-tools/this-is-without-a-doubt-the-coolest-sketch-technique-youll-see-all-day-ddefa65ea959#.pevfkykqk">Jon Moore</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@lloyd/sketch-symbols-best-practices-now-that-nested-overrides-are-a-thing-9b651d3fe1a4#.3jsbforui">Lloyd Humphries</a>, do a fantastic job of highlighting how best to approach utilizing deep nested symbols in building components within Sketch.</p>

      <p>Jon Moore's UX Power Tools Toolbox became my starting point, which comes preloaded with entire ecosystem of symbols and components. I spent several days tinkering and learning, learning and tinkering, until finally I had put together a library of components that was fit for Sundance.org.</p>

      <p><strong>If my symbols page looks scary to you, that's because it is. But I promise, there is genius to this madness.</strong></p>

      <p>At this point, the bulk of the work in Sketch was completed. Nearly every component used in any design was constructed using symbols, meaning perfect consistently across the entire design landscape</p>

      <p>Going through this process also forced me to address a lot of other issues that were present in my initial designs. For example, Sundance.org lacked a true baseline grid, which gave the site a perceptibly poor vertical rhythm. To rectify this, I spent almost an entire day recalculating every space and line-height throughout the entire site. It's astonishing how subtle that change was, but how much of an impact it had on every single page. With these tweaks out of the way, our team would now need to strategize on how to go about implementing a complete refactoring of the site's CSS.</p>

      <h4 id="code">II. Refactoring with ITCSS/BEM</h4>

      <p>Without proper rules and strategy, CSS is a language that lends itself to misuse. Often times developers will write styles specific to one component without thinking critically about how that code could be reused across other elements. This is what happened with me in 2014 when we relaunched Sundance.org. I had been the sole author of all the CSS during that project. I'm still embarrassed to this day at how long my selectors were.</p>

      <p>After lots of research and deliberation about how we wanted to approach architecting our CSS, one methodology emerged called ITCSS. The ITCSS methodology is based on the idea of organizing CSS in an inverted triangle starting from most broad and far-reaching styles at the top of the hierarchy and building downward to increasingly specific elements.</p>

      <p>Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:</p>

      <ul class="o-list-bare">
        <li>1. Settings (variables, font sizes, colors, configs)</li>
        <li>2. Tools (preprocessor mixins and functions)</li>
        <li>3. Generic (normalize, reset, box-sizing)</li>
        <li>4. Elements (HTML DOM elements, no classes)</li>
        <li>5. Objects (non-cosmetic design patterns like wrappers and layouts)</li>
        <li>6. Components (cosmetic design patterns)</li>
        <li>7. Overrides (otherwise known as the shame folder)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Harry Roberts (the creator) provides a fantastic, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-scale-web-projects-new-css-architecture-itcss-41514731">in-depth explanation</a> of how ITCSS works.</p>

      <p>We had initially wanted to avoid the use of a framework since they often bring with it a ton of unwanted styles that must first be untangled. Thankfully, as luck would have it, Harry Roberts created <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/inuitcss" target="_blank">InuitCSS</a>. InuitCSS is a framework comprised of both ITCSS methodology and BEM naming conventions. A framework in its purest sense, InuitCSS comes only with the basic architecture of a CSS library. It contains nothing in the way of aesthetic. Furthermore, InuitCSS has so much utility out of the box that you can assemble entire patterns without having to write very many custom class styles.</p>

      <p>With our Sketch components completely laid out and a new CSS methodology, the only thing left was the hardest part... execution.</p>

      <h4 id="jekyll">III. Abstract Refactoring</h4>

      <p>Making sweeping changes to a website's codebase is full of risks and coordinating work between the team becomes very challenging when you have to deal with the fact that projects are constantly in motion. We really wanted to avoid this nightmare as much as possible. What I opted to do was to build out all every single one of Sundance.org's many components using ITCSS and InuitCSS. The refactor happened primarily in abstraction before the CSS was moved over and fitted into Sundance.org.</p>

      <p>Being such a huge fan of Jekyll, I decided to spin up a new site, install InuitCSS, and start building components. Eventually what emerged from all that work is a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://sundance-org.github.io/styles/cards/">living styleguide</a>, which our developers could then use for documentation, code snippets, and live examples. This was more of an unintended consequence and, Sundance's team being so small, kind of superfluous. It did end up helping a lot, especially when external vendors were contributing.</p>

      <p>With the bulk of the front end work done in advance, the process of integrating into Sundance.org was far less painful than I imagine most CSS refactors can be. The new CSS was put into place, and the old code stripped away piece by piece. The extend function in SASS enabled us to apply a lot of CSS without having to rebuild existing front end components.</p>
