      <h3>Sundance.org Photo Gallery</h3>
      <p>Client: Sundance Institute<br>

      <h4>Framing the Problem</h4>
      <p>In late 2014 Sundance.org was rebuilt from the ground up, however, photo galleries were not part of what was migrated into the new site. In addition to being one of the most highly trafficked content types on the older version of the website, photo galleries are also a necessary component of the marketing team’s overall content plan and Sundance’s primary means of visually representing its institutional history.</p>

      <p>The Big Challenges:</p>
      <ul class="">
        <li>Tens of thousands of photos would eventually populate this gallery and would need to be curated, organized, and accessible.</li>
        <li>Our design solution would need to highlight all of the organization’s activity, which spans dozens of programs, labs, events, and festivals. </li>
        <li>We had only a few weeks to deliver our solution in time for it to be built ahead of the 2017 Sundance Film Festival.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="o-spacer__top--large">Time Constraints and Sacrifices</h4>
      <p>With only a few short weeks to complete our work, we carefully prioritized our approach by opting only to involve users when we reached a stage where we would be testing our prototype. We believed if we could generate our ideas quickly enough, this would allow us to prototype and test with users, while still having time to make big changes if those tests didn’t go so well.</p>

      <h4>Comparative Analysis</h4>
      <p>We organized a diverse group of participants from the marketing and technology teams to look through several different comparative products where the presentation of photography was done well.</p>

      <p>The observations from that meeting were organized into five key design guidelines:</p>


      <ul class="">
        <li>Vertical scrolling preferred method for browsing</li>
        <li>A robust search feature was necessary</li>
        <li>Tagging helps create key relationships between content</li>
        <li>UI consistency must be enforced</li>
        <li>Simplicity is paramount</li>
      </ul>


      <h4 class="o-spacer__top--large">Group Sketching</h4>
      <p>We gathered again for a two-hour session where all of the group participants carefully reviewed our design guidelines, project goals, and requirements.</p>

      <p>I then led the group through an intense, time-constrained, sketching session. First, I had them create as many ideas as possible in a very short amount of time. I then challenged each person to organize their ideas into a single concept before having each person present that concept to the group. I collected the artifacts from this meeting and used them to make a decision about which direction we should go.</p>

      <h4>The Solution</h4>
      <p>There appeared to be a similar solution running through most of the different concepts. The best way of organizing and engaging with this hypothetical body of photography was going to work based on tagging.</p>

      <p>Using tags as a parameter that could be queried, we could filter the page based on the kinds of tags the user was searching or browsing for. We could also create custom tags, which would enable us to share special, curated galleries.</p>

      <p>The stakeholders, who were involved in the process from the very beginning, were enthusiastic about the idea.</p>

      <h4>Prototyping and Testing</h4>
      <p>We pulled in a handful of users from our community and watched them interact with the new feature. In addition to a few minor usability issues, we identified a few larger issues:</p>

      <p>Mobile tag selection and filtering was going to require more attention.</p>
      <p>Our solution more closely resembles a tool than it does an entertaining piece of content. Future iterations will need to enhance content curation and user engagement.</p>

      <h4>Takeaways</h4>
      <ul class="">
        <li>User feedback is crucial and you can’t afford to not to interact with your users on every project</li>
        <li>Compressed project timelines are not ideal, but sometimes being under the gun can force unexpected, positive creative output</li>
        <li>Involving your stakeholders and developers in your project can be tremendously helpful</li>
      </ul>
