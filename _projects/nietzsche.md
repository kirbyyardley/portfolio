      <h2>Nietzche's <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, One Paragraph at a Time</h2>

      <p><em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> is comprised of 296 paragraphs, or aphorisms, each of which is densely packed with the profound thoughts of one of the worlds most incredible thinkers.</p>

      <p>I've been attempting to read this short book for years, but every one of my attempts is met with frustration because I have a difficult time understanding such profoundly dense material. I soon realized that the only way I was going to properly read and understand this book was by taking each paragraph apart one by one, and rewriting them in my own language.</p>
